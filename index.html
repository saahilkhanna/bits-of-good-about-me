                I am a second year computer science major and I enjoy programming especially to create impact. Thus,
                I love taking part in hackathons and other forms of project-based learning. That is why I am especially excited to join! 
                     
                In my free time I like to spend time with friends and play basketball. I am originally form Bangalore, India but 
                moved to the Unites States when I was 8 years old. I have since lived in 3 states: North Carolina, Nebraska, and most recently Georgia.
                I went to highschool here in Georgia in Johns Creek.
